# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I wanted to try something like the Desktop Goose if you have heard about that. It basically is just a goose that hangs around
on your screen and brings memes onto your screen.

I also wanted to try the pong game but have certain words or links pop up when it reaches a certain sccore. For example, when
the score becomes 6 to 9, it says nice on the screen. Or if the score is 9 to 5 then it plays Dolly Parton's song 9 to 5.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Not right now.
